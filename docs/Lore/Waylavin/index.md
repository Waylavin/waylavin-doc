# Story of the Old City

## Once, Waylavin was peaceful.

It's orchards full of fruit, it's farms bountiful every harvest, and its people were never seen without a smile. Every market stall bursting with gold coins, and every knight lazing about, as there was no crime to fight, no greater enemy then just how hard it was to shine that old armor they wore. 

The kingdom was prosperous then. The king was kind, and just. The Northmen, a scattering of tribes, the people that came from there were warm, and familial, far different then the snowy tundra they hailed from. They always had spare food they brought back to Waylavin, to trade.they were a warm people, and flocked to the warm king.

After that, was the Bamboori. Named that after their odd tongue, and strange hats. The hailed from the furthest reaches of the east. The taught the people of Waylavin strange techniques, such as how to use gunpowder, grow their fields properly, and what the uses of the odd 'gears' were. They were an honorable people, and flocked to the honorable king.

And lastly, were the warriors of the west. A strange people, that had strange ways. They were greedy, but polite, selling olives and vegetables, steel tools and weapons. They loved gold above all else, their halls draped in purple dye, and their climate warm. They loved riches, and flocked to the rich king.

## Waylavin was… once peaceful

The warriors from the west, the Spartasi, desired more gold, and approached the king, asking "we are rich as can be, but you are richer than even us, how do we become like you, great king?" the king, as he was wise, said "seek your fortune from yourselves, and be happy with what you are. Riches come to those who wait"

But they did not wait. They were not patient. They talked with the Bamboori, and asked them, to use the gears, to give them more time. If time is how he is rich, why not make time eternal? The Bamboori liked this thought, and their curiosity got the best of them. They were trusted by the king, and any request that was asked of them, was fulfilled. So they built a machine. A strange machine, that bent time.

The Spartasi were jealous of the ingenuity, and trust of the Bamboori, and knew they had made something that could change time itself. They approached the Bamboori, and said "we will pay you all our gold, so will you give us this machine?"

The Bamboori refused, stating 'we do not know much of this thing we have made. It is beyond us, even if we made it. We need to understand it, before we can use it"

However, the spartasi were impatient, and stole the machine away, under the cover of the night. They then approached the king, and said

"We have made a machine, for you, kind king. It will give you time eternal. Your life will no longer end all we ask for is a measly pittance of gold"

The king, as all kings do, wished for his reign to not end. He wished for his people to live happily forever, so he said "i will accept this gift, and will give you the gold you seek"

And then the king turned on the machine, stepping into it.

This is where the story of Waylavin begins. Not in peace, but in ruin.

Waylavin fractured, upon the release of the time energy. Buildings aging at a rate so quick, it seemed impossible. The spartasi fled, desperate to escape the horrors of time fracturing around them, fleeing with the gold the king gave, as they watched in fear as the king aged, and de-aged, seeming to suffer through centuries of stillness and time. Rifts, fractures in time appeared all around, turning many to but dust. Thousands died. The only survivors are those that fled. 

The northmen, fleeing on their ships they had come to love, horrified at what the old city they had come to love had fallen to. The Bamboori, recognizing what had happened, ran to the castle, to collect what remained of the machine, to hopefully one day fix time. And the king, trapped in eternity, fell to madness. Few survived that day. And the ones that did, fled to their homelands, desperate for the safety of their old homes…

The rifts have not disappeared, however. They did not slow down. Some gaps grew so large, that the time itself, aged….turning all to rust. rust is all that's left, when time itself ages. Rust, and gears. Some say if you peek your head in, you can sometimes see the gigantic gears of time itself trying to turn, struggling to continue. Some places are so timeless, that the earth itself is rusted over, creatures from nightmares…fake similes of what seraphs were meant to be, wandering around, screeching, covered in metal, faceless, and rusted… 

During the very beginning of the world's end, a Bamboori, by the name of 'jonas' wished to fix it. He harvested what time he could, and built machines to wait it out; to outlast the rifts. Seraphs from all the factions, the ones still with hope, gathered, to try and find peace, in a later time. Jonas led them to a (you guys put whatever building it is, here) where the had their time frozen.

They are waking now. Not because the rifts stopped, but they are getting WORSE. A strange, timeless rusted creature, with a neck taller then the sky has been sighted. A horrid, rusted crow spreading the Devestation of rust. And creaking of machinery low below, rusted over like everything else…

This is where you come in. this is the world you live in. twisted by time, shattered by existence, and left in a future devoid of hope, and yet you seem filled with it. What will you do? What will you make? Fate has no hold here. Nor does time. Now that i've told you the story of this place. Of waylavin, i ask of you. What story will you make, seraph?
